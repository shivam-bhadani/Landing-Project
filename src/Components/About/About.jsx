                    It’s the year 2777. The biological and geological condition of planet Earth is depreciating with each passing day. The entire ecosystem of the planet has collapsed, the population is reducing rapidly, and the planet is no longer considered a habitable place. The scientists tried finding estates in the neighboring galaxies, however, the sly aliens have banned humanity, leaving them with no other choice but to discover new galaxies. Looking at the graveness of the situation, the scientists have planned a secret mission - ‘Live Again’ in a quest to search for habitable celestial bodies in far off cosmic neighborhood after hours and hours of intense research, several experiments, and strategic planning, the scientists are finally going to explore opportunities to buy estates beyond the borders.
